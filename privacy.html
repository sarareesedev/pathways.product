                        We believe that the security and privacy of your information are of the utmost importance. This Privacy
                        Policy explains what information we collect and how we use it - but our philosophy is simple: we treat
                        your information as we wish our own to be treated - with the highest standards of care and
                        confidentiality.

                        Unless we are required to do so by law or by a regulatory body, we never use, disclose or sell your
                        personal data for marketing purposes.
